My solution for Enterwell's Quiz Maker app

1. After clonning the repo, navigate to it and run

```
npm install
```

2. This app uses a node.js server as a middleware so before running the app, open the terminal and run

```
node server.cjs
```

3. Once the server is running, open another terminal and run

```
npm run dev
```
